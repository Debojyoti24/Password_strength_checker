# Password Strength Checker 🛡️

This project is a simple yet effective Password Strength Checker application. It provides real-time feedback on the strength of a password as the user types it in. The application evaluates the password against a set of criteria, including length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Based on these criteria, it calculates a strength score and updates the UI to reflect the password's strength level, making it easier for users to create secure passwords.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-time Feedback:** Provides immediate feedback on password strength as the user types. ⏱️
- **Strength Meter:** Visual representation of password strength using a dynamic bar. 📊
- **Criteria List:** Clear display of password criteria, indicating which requirements are met. ✅
- **Password Visibility Toggle:** Allows users to toggle the visibility of the password for easier input. 👀
